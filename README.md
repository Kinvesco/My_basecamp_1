# Welcome to My Basecamp 1

## Task
The task at hand is to create a web-based project management tool similar to Basecamp. The project needs to have three main parts: a database, a backend, and a frontend. The goal is to enable users to create accounts, log in and log out, and create projects. Additionally, there should be role permissions, distinguishing between regular users and administrators. Admins should have the ability to create, edit, and delete projects, and the admin permission should also be removable from a user.
